# Employee Database

## Description
In this project, I developed a command-line application using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL to manage a company's employee database. The application established a connection with the MySQL database that stored data about employees, roles, and departments, using MySQL2 Node.js driver.

The Inquirer module was used to create an interactive interface, offering the user a range of options from viewing all employees, roles, departments, to adding new roles, departments or employees, and updating an employee's role. Depending on user selection, the application executed the corresponding SQL query to fetch, insert or update data in the database, effectively managing the company's employee information.
